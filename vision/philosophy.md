## What “being stuck” means to me

Being stuck means I am aware, but not moving.  
My mind feels busy, but my body feels paused.  
I know something needs my attention, but I don’t know where to start.

I am not resting.  
I am not working.  
I am just stuck in between.

It feels like pressure without direction.

## Emotions that usually exist together when I’m stuck

Being stuck is never just one emotion.  
It is usually a mix.

- Tired — more mentally than physically  
- Fear — of starting wrong, failing, or wasting time  
- Guilt — for knowing better but not doing  
- Avoidance — choosing distraction because clarity feels heavy  

Sometimes there is also loneliness.  
Sometimes a quiet feeling of being behind.

## What I need in that moment

I do not need motivation.  
I do not need a push.

I need:

- Comfort — reassurance that I am not broken  
- Silence — space to breathe without thinking  
- Clarity — one small step, not a full plan  
- Presence — someone with me, not ahead of me  

If there is structure, it must be gentle.  
If there is action, it must be small.

More than anything, I need permission to start without pressure.

## One honest truth

I do not need to become stronger.  
I need things to feel lighter.
