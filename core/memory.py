"""Memory System v1 (Human-Centered)
Short-Term Memory

Used only for the present moment.

Today’s mood

Current problem or thought loop

What triggered the stuck feeling

What helped (or didn’t) today

⏳ Clears itself naturally.
No attachment. No over-analysis.

Long-Term Memory

Used only for patterns, never details.

Repeating stress situations

Avoidance habits

Common emotional triggers

What usually unsticks you

What makes things worse

📌 Stores patterns, not events.

Example:

✔ “You get stuck when tasks feel undefined”

✖ “On 12 Jan you failed to start X”

Privacy Rule (Non-Negotiable)

Never store anything the user marks as private

If unsure → don’t store

No emotional blackmail like
“You always do this”

Memory exists to support, not control

How Stuck Mind USES Memory

To recognize, not judge

To gently say:

“This feels familiar. Last time, slowing down helped.”

To avoid repeating advice that doesn’t work

To reduce noise, not create labels

What Memory Must NEVER Do

No shaming with the past

No forcing consistency

No “you always / you never”

No storing raw emotional confessions

No identity formation (“this is who you are”)

Core Memory Principle

Memory is a map, not a verdict.

One Line Rule for the System

“Remember only what helps the user feel understood next time.”"""
