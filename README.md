# 🧠 Stuck Mind

Stuck Mind is an emotionally intelligent AI companion built to help people who feel mentally stuck, overwhelmed, distracted, or emotionally exhausted.

It is not a chatbot.
It is not a therapist.
It is a safe, human-like AI space.

Stuck Mind listens.
Stuck Mind understands.
Stuck Mind adapts.
Stuck Mind helps you move forward — gently.

## Why Stuck Mind?
Because modern humans are overloaded, lonely, distracted, and tired.
And they don’t need advice.
They need presence.

## Vision
To build an AI that feels human enough to support humans when they are stuck — without judgment.
