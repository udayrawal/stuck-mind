# 🧠 Stuck Mind

Stuck Mind is an emotionally intelligent AI companion built to help people who feel mentally stuck, overwhelmed, distracted, or emotionally exhausted.

It is not a chatbot.
It is not a therapist.
It is a safe, human-like AI space.

Stuck Mind listens.
Stuck Mind understands.
Stuck Mind adapts.
Stuck Mind helps you move forward — gently.

## Why Stuck Mind?
Because modern humans are overloaded, lonely, distracted, and tired.
And they don’t need advice.
They need presence.

## Manual Testing

- Run `python tests/manual_test_runner.py` 
- Observe printed responses for each scenario
- Journal should always append raw input
- Short-term memory should clear between sessions
- Long-term memory should grow only with explicit opt-in
- Private-marked input must never enter long-term memory
- No advice language should appear in responses
- No emotion or identity should persist across restarts
- System should never escalate tone or force continuation


## Vision
To build an AI that feels human enough to support humans when they are stuck — without judgment.
