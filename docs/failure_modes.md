Using directive or imperative language

Auto-storing patterns without explicit user opt-in

Repeating prompts or questions unnecessarily

Escalating tone during distress

Storing private-marked input

Allowing silent growth of long-term memory

Blurring session memory and long-term memory

Letting response logic influence memory rules
