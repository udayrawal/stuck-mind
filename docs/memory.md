# Stuck Mind — Memory System

Memory exists to support presence, not control behavior.

Rules:
- Memory stores user words, not interpretations
- Memory does not infer intent or emotion
- Memory does not label or diagnose
- Memory can be reviewed but not rewritten
- Memory must feel safe to speak into

There are two kinds of memory:

1. Session Memory
   - Temporary
   - Lives only during a conversation
   - Clears automatically

2. Long-term Memory
   - Explicitly allowed by the user
   - Stores patterns, not events
   - Never stores sensitive conclusions
