# Session Rules

- A session starts when the chat begins
- A session exists only for the current interaction
- A session ends only on explicit exit or inactivity
- Short-term memory is cleared when a session ends
- Emotional state is never persisted across sessions
- Long-term memory is stored only through explicit user opt-in
- Journal entries persist across sessions as raw records
- No session data is used to infer identity or behavior
